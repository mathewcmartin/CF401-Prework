### Submitting Your Work

- If you don't have one already, create a repository in your Git Hub account for prework. Create or modify a branch for this repository called codecademy. Create a README.md file describing the repository and the work you're putting into it. Push to this repository your code from the following CodeCademy assignments:

- Unit 3: PygLatin - part 10
- Unit 4: Taking a Vacation - part 7
- Unit 5: A Day at the Supermarket - part 12
- Unit 6: Student Becomes the Teacher - part 9
- Unit 7: Battleship! - part 18

- Submit a pull request to your master branch, but do not yet merge it. Copy the URL for the pull request and submit that URL to Canvas for the Prework assignment. After you do this, merge your work to your master branch.

- Use the comments function in Canvas to submit questions, comments, and reflections on this work. We will get the results from your Coding Bat work automatically, so don't worry about that. Because this is not an HTML/CSS/JS course, those assignments will not be graded in any detail.
